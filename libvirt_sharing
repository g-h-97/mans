# this is how to share a folder bitween host and guests :
# https://xapax.github.io/blog/2017/05/09/sharing-files-kvm.html

# create a folder in the host and change it's group owner to 'libvirt'
	mkdir /home/user/share

# in virt-manager create a new hardware 'filesystem share' set :
	tyep : mount
	driver : Default
	mode : Squash
	Source path : /home/user/share
	Target path : share ( this is just a word, it's not actually a path)

# start the guest vm, and type in the terminal
	mkdir /home/guest_user/hostfiles
	mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L share (Target path) /home/user/hostfiles
