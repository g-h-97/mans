# this is about cli scripting in general

# and starting with if statements form the link : https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linux/conditions-in-bash-scripting-if-statements/

# if statements syntax is like :

	if [ condition ]; then
		command1
		command2 
		.
		.
	elif [ condition ]; then
		command1
		command2
		.
		.
	else
		command1
		command2
		.
		.
	fi

# Note 1 always keep spaces between the 'conditin' and the brackets [ condition ], exactly like 'test condition'
# Note that ';' is equal to newline '\n' aka 'pressing enter'
# Note that the brackets are equal to 'test' command, this is really important

	if [ <args> condition ]
	
	# is exactly the same as
	
	if test <args> condition

# in order to performe multiple tests use 
	# '&&' or '-a' for 'and'
	# '||' or '-o' for 'or'

# test has a handful of arguments like
	# -a for 'and' exactly like '&&'
	# -o for 'or' exactly like '||'
	# -f check if file exists
	# -d check if directory exists
	# -r is it readable
	# -w is it writable
	# -eq numerical equality
	# ....and a lot more check 'man test' for the complete lis
