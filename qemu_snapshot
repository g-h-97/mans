# this is how to create a snapshot of a virtual machine using qemu-img
# a snapshot is basically a file that get changed instead of the original vm disk file using write redirection to the snapshot file

# Note that the vm shoud be off
# the command is
//qemu-img create -f [foramt] -b [path/originaldisk.format] [snapshot.format]

# after this start the vm from the [snapthot.format] instead of the [originaldisk.format]
# if you want to revert back start from the previous disk image
