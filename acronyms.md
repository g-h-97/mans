`SECDEC`: Single Error Correction & Double Error Detection
    Is the ablility of memory to correct single bit curruption using "ECC" and detect double bit curruption without correcting them.
`ECC Memory`: Error Correction Code Memory
    Is a type of Random Access Memory that is capable of detecting & correcting data corruption in memory, such as bit flips. Caused mainly by the electric & magnitic interference and secondly by the cosmic rays from outer space, meaning the higher the altitude the higher the risk of facing data curruption.
    This type is caracterized by having Nine "9" instead of "8" chips on each side.
