<h3>Searching Files on UNIX</h3>

On <a href="mpe.html">MPE</a> you can display files
using the :Print command, Fcopy, <a href="nuggets.html#magnet">Magnet</a>,
or <a href="qedit.html">Qedit</a> (with pattern
match searches). On <a href="hp-ux.html">HP-UX</a>
you can display files using <b>cat</b> and even better using
<b>more</b> (and string search using the slash "/" command), and
<a href="qedit.html">Qedit</a> (including searches of $Include files, and so on),
but if you really want to search for patterns of text
like a UNIX guru, <a href="#grep">grep</a> is the tool for you.
<p>
<a href="regexpr1.txt">Text version.</a>

<table border>
<tr>
<td>cat report.c<td>{prints file on stdout, no pauses}
<tr>
<td>cat -v -e -t dump<td>{show non-printing characters too}
<tr>
<td>cat &gt;newfile<td>{reads from stdin, writes to 'newfile'}
<tr>
<td>cat rpt1.c inp.c test.s &gt;newfile<td>{combine 3 files into 1}
<tr>
<td>more report.c<td>{space for next page, q to quit}
<tr>
<td>ps -a | more<td>{page through the full output of ps}
<tr>
<td>grep smug *.txt<td>{search *.txt files for 'smug'}</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
MPE users will take a while to remember that
<b>more</b>, like most UNIX tools,
responds to a Return by printing the next line,
not the next screen. Use the Spacebar to print the next
page.  Type "q" to quit.
To scan ahead to find a string pattern, type "/" and enter
a <a href="#expression">regular expression</a> to match.
For further help, type "h".

<a name="grep"><h4>Searching Files Using UNIX grep</h4></a>

The <b>grep</b> program is a standard
<A HREF="unix.html">UNIX</A>
utility that searches through a set of files for an arbitrary text
pattern, specified through a
<a href="#expression">regular expression.</a>
Also check the <a href="manpages.html">man pages as well</a>
for <STRONG>egrep</STRONG> and <STRONG>fgrep</STRONG>. The
<A HREF="mpe.html">MPE</A>
equivalents are
<b>MPEX</b>
and
<A HREF="nuggets.html#magnet">Magnet</A>, both third-party products.
By default, grep is case-sensitive (use -i to ignore case).
By default, grep ignores the context of a string (use -w to
match <i>words</i> only).
By default, grep shows the lines that match (use -v to show
those that <b>don't</b> match).

<table border>
<tr>
<td> % grep BOB tmpfile<td>{search 'tmpfile' for 'BOB' anywhere in a line}
<tr>
<td> % grep -i -w blkptr * <td>{search files in <a href="cwd.html">CWD</a> for word <i>blkptr</i>, any case}
<tr>
<td> % grep run[- ]time *.txt<td>{find 'run time' or 'run-time' in all txt files}
<tr>
<td> % who | grep root <td>{pipe <b>who</b> to <b>grep</b>, look for <i>root</i>}</td></tr>

<a name="expression"><h4>Understanding Regular Expressions</h4></a>

<b>Regular Expressions</b> are a feature of <a href="unix.html">UNIX</a>.
They describe a pattern to match, a sequence of characters,
not words, within a line of text.
Here is a quick summary of the special characters used
in the <a href="#grep">grep</a> tool and their meaning:
<p>
<a href="regexpr3.txt">Text version.</a>
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td>^ (Caret)<td>=<td>match expression at the start of a line, as in ^A.
<tr>
<td>$ (Question)<td>=<td>match expression at the end of a line, as in A$.
<tr>
<td>\ (Back Slash)<td>=<td>turn off the special meaning of the next character, as in \^.
<tr>
<td>[ ] (Brackets)<td>=<td>match any <b>one</b> of the enclosed characters, as in [aeiou].
Use Hyphen "-" for a range, as in <code>[0-9]</code>.
<tr>
<td>[^ ]<td>=<td>match any one character <b>except</b> those enclosed in [ ], as in [^0-9].
<tr>
<td>. (Period)<td>=<td>match a single character of any value, except end of line.
<tr>
<td>* (Asterisk)<td>=<td>match zero or more of the preceding character or expression.
<tr>
<td>\{x,y\}<td>=<td>match <b>x</b> to <b>y</b> occurrences of the preceding.
<tr>
<td>\{x\}<td>=<td>match exactly <b>x</b> occurrences of the preceding.
<tr>
<td>\{x,\}<td>=<td>match <b>x</b> or more occurrences of the preceding.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
As an <a href="mpe.html">MPE</a> user, you may
find regular expressions difficult to use at first.
Please persevere, because they are used in many
UNIX tools, from <b>more</b> to <b>perl</b>.
Unfortunately, some tools use simple regular expressions and others use extended
regular expressions and some extended features have been merged
into simple tools, so that it looks as if every tool has its own
syntax. Not only that, regular expressions use the
same characters as shell <a href="wildcard.html">wildcarding</a>,
but they are <b>not</b> used in exactly the same way.
What do you expect of an operating system built by graduate students?
<p>
Since you usually type regular expressions within
shell commands, it is good practice to enclose the regular
expression in single quotes (') to stop the shell from expanding
it before passing the argument to your search tool.
Here are some examples using <b>grep</b>:
<p>
<a href="regexpr4.txt">Text version.</a>
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td>grep smug files<td>{search <i>files</i> for lines with 'smug'}
<tr>
<td>grep '^smug' files<td>{'smug' at the start of a line}
<tr>
<td>grep 'smug$' files<td>{'smug' at the end of a line}
<tr>
<td>grep '^smug$' files<td>{lines containing only 'smug'}
<tr>
<td>grep '^\^s' files<td>{lines starting with '^s', "\" escapes the ^}
<tr>
<td>grep '[Ss]mug' files<td>{search for 'Smug' or 'smug'}
<tr>
<td>grep 'B[oO][bB]' files<td>{search for BOB, Bob, BOb or BoB }
<tr>
<td>grep '^$' files<td>{search for blank lines}
<tr>
<td>grep '[0-9][0-9]' file<td>{search for pairs of numeric digits}</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<b>Back Slash</b> "\" is used to <i>escape</i> the next
symbol, for example, turn off the special meaning that it has.
To look for a Caret "^" at the start of a line, the
expression is <code>^\^</code>.
<b>Period</b> "." matches any single character. So <code>b.b</code> will
match "bob", "bib", "b-b", etc.
<b>Asterisk</b> "*" does not mean the same thing in regular expressions
as in wildcarding; it is a modifier that applies to the
preceding single character, or expression such as <code>[0-9]</code>.
An asterisk matches <b>zero</b> or more of what precedes it.
Thus <code>[A-Z]*</code> matches any number of upper-case letters,
including none, while <code>[A-Z][A-Z]*</code> matches <b>one</b>
or more upper-case letters.
<p>
The <b>vi</b> editor uses <code>\&lt; \&gt;</code> to match characters
at the beginning and/or end of a <b>word boundary</b>.
A word boundary is either the edge of the line or any character
except a letter, digit or underscore "_".
To look for <code>if</code>, but skip <code>stiff</code>, the
expression is <code>\&lt;if\&gt;</code>.
For the
same logic in <b>grep</b>, invoke it with the <b>-w</b> option.
And remember that
regular expressions are <b>case-sensitive</b>.  If you don't
care about the case, the expression to match "if" would be
<code>[Ii][Ff]</code>,
where the characters in <b>square brackets</b> define a character
set from which the pattern must match one character. Alternatively, you
could also invoke <b>grep</b> with the <b>-i</b> option to ignore case.
<P>
Here are a few more examples of <b>grep</b> to show you what
can be done:
<p>
<a href="regexpr5.txt">Text version.</a>
<p>
<table border>
<tr>
<td>grep '^From: ' /usr/mail/$USER<td>{list your mail}
<tr>
<td>grep '[a-zA-Z]'<td>{any line with at least one letter}
<tr>
<td>grep '[^a-zA-Z0-9]<td>{anything not a letter or number}
<tr>
<td>grep '[0-9]\{3\}-[0-9]\{4\}'<td>{999-9999, like phone numbers}
<tr>
<td>grep '^.$'<td>{lines with exactly one character}
<tr>
<td>grep '"smug"'<td>{'smug' within double quotes}
<tr>
<td>grep '"*smug"*'<td>{'smug', with or without quotes}
<tr>
<td>grep '^\.'<td>{any line that starts with a Period "."}
<tr>
<td>grep '^\.[a-z][a-z]'<td>{line start with "." and 2 lc letters}</td></tr>
